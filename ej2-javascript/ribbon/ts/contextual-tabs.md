# Ribbon Contextual Tabs

Contextual tabs are similar to Ribbon tabs that show up when you're working on something specific, such as an image or a table. Just select an image, table, or any other element, and the relevant tabs with configured options will appear at the Tab panel, allowing you to work faster and more efficiently.

## Adding Contextual Tabs

To add contextual tabs in Ribbon, you can utilize the [contextualTabs](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/ribbon#contextualTabs) property. This property accepts an array of Ribbon tabs where you can add multiple tabs as per needs.

## Visible Tabs

You can utilize the [visible](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/ribbon#contextualTabs#visible) property within each tab to control the visibility of the contextual tab and its associated content.

## Selected Tabs

By using the [isSelected](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/ribbon#contextualTabs#isSelected) property within each tab object, you can control the selection state of each contextual tab and indicate which tab is currently active.

## Methods

### Show Tab

You can make the specific tab visible by using the [showTab](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/ribbon#contextualTabs#showTab) method available in the Ribbon.

### Hide Tab

You can also hide specific tab by using the [hideTab](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/ribbon#contextualTabs#showTab) method available in the Ribbon.
