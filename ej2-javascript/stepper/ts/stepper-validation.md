# Validating steps 

Use the `isValid` property in the Stepper to check the status of a specific step.

When `isValid` is set to true, the step meets the required criteria. If set to `false`, the step needs attention or completion. It provides clear feedback on the status of individual steps within the Stepper, enhancing the user interaction.
