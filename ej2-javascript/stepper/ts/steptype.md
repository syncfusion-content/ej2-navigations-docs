# StepType

The `stepType` property in the Stepper determines whether steps should be displayed using only with indicators, only labels, or a combination of both. The available values for this property are `default`, `label`, and `indicator`.

## Default

Steps are displayed with icons and the labels when defined.

## Label

Steps are displayed with their defined labels only.


### Label positions

The Stepper control allows you to place the label on the top, bottom, left, or right side of the stepper using the `labelPosition` property.

The following label positions are supported in stepper:

* Top: The label is placed on the top of the stepper.
* Bottom: The label is placed on the bottom of the stepper.
* Left: The label is placed on the left side of the stepper.
* Right: The label is placed on the right side of the stepper.

## Indicator

Steps are displayed with only indicators.
