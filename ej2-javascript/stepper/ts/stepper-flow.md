# Stepper Flow

The Stepper component provides control over the flow of steps through the utilization of the `linear` property.

## Linear flow

When the `linear` property is set to `true`, it enables a linear progression. You can move through steps one after another. By default, the `linear` property value is `false`.

## Non-Linear flow

In non-liner flow, the users can skip or complete steps in any order they like.

## Configure activeStep

The `activeStep` in the Stepper represents the step currently in the focus or selected by the user. You can set the active step of the stepper by assigning a value to the activeStep property. By default the `activeStep` is `0`.
