# Stepper Flow

The Stepper component provides control over the flow of steps through the utilization of the `linear` property.

## Linear flow

When the `linear` property is set to `true`, it enables a linear progression. In this mode, users move through steps sequentially, one after the other maintaining a fixed order. By default, the `linear` property value is `false`.

## Non-Linear flow

In non-liner flow, the users have the flexibility to skip or complete steps in any order they prefer.

## Configure activeStep

The `activeStep` in the Stepper represents the step currently in the focus or selected by the user.

When users interact with the Stepper, the `activeStep` indicates the progress within the sequence of steps. The activeStep dynamically changes as users navigate through the steps, helping to maintain a user-centric and intuitive experience. By default the `activeStep` is `0`.
