# Customizing Stepper Steps with Templates

You can personalize the appearance of Stepper steps by using the `template` property. It enables the customization feature for different progress states within the stepper, encompassing indicators and the progress bar.

Below are examples demonstrating the customization of Stepper steps using the template support:

## Icon Only
Customize the stepper step with only an icon for a minimalist visual representation.


## Icon with Label
Tailor the stepper step by combining an icon with a label, providing additional context and information.

## Icon with Text
Enhance the stepper step by incorporating both an icon and text, creating a visual representation with textual details.
