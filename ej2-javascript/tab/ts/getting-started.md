# Getting started in ##Platform_Name## Tab control

This section briefly explains about how to create a simple [JavaScript Tab](https://www.syncfusion.com/javascript-ui-controls/js-tabs) using TypeScript and configure the Tab header content using Essential JS 2 [quickstart](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-quickstart-webpack-) seed repository.

> This application is integrated with the `webpack.config.js` configuration and uses the latest version of the [webpack-cli](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#commands). It requires node `v14.15.0` or higher. For more information about webpack and its features, refer to the [webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/).

## Dependencies

The following is the list of dependencies required to use the Tab component in your application.

```js
|-- @syncfusion/ej2-navigations
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-base
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-buttons
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-popups
```

## Set up development environment

Open the command prompt from the required directory, and run the following command to clone the Syncfusion JavaScript (Essential JS 2) quickstart project from [GitHub](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-quickstart-webpack-).

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="CMD" %}

git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-quickstart-webpack- ej2-quickstart

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

After cloning the application in the `ej2-quickstart` folder, run the following command line to navigate to the `ej2-quickstart` folder.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="CMD" %}

cd ej2-quickstart

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Add Syncfusion JavaScript packages

Syncfusion JavaScript (Essential JS 2) packages are available on the [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg) public registry. You can install all Syncfusion JavaScript (Essential JS 2) controls in a single [@syncfusion/ej2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2) package or individual packages for each control.

The quickstart application is preconfigured with the dependent [@syncfusion/ej2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2) package in the `~/package.json` file. Use the following command to install the dependent npm packages from the command prompt.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="NPM" %}

npm install

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Import the Syncfusion CSS styles

The Tab CSS files are available in the `ej2-navigations` package folder. This can be referenced in the `~/src/styles/styles.css` file of your application using the following code.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight css tabtitle="style.css" %}

@import '../../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css';
@import '../../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-buttons/styles/material.css';
@import '../../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-popups/styles/material.css';
@import '../../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-navigations/styles/material.css';

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Initialize the Tab using JSON items collection

The Tab can be rendered by defining a JSON array. The item is rendered with [`header`](../api/tab/tabItem/#header) text and [`content`](../api/tab/tabItem/#content) for each Tab using [`items`](../api/tab#items) property.

* Add the HTML div tag with its id attribute as `element` in your `index.html` file to initialize the Tab.

`[src/index.html]`

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}

`[src/app/app.ts]`

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.ts" %}

import { Tab } from '@syncfusion/ej2-navigations';

let tabObj: Tab = new Tab({
    items: [

        }
    ]
});
tabObj.appendTo('#element');

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

* Run the application in the browser using the following command.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="NPM" %}

npm start

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Output will be as follows:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/tab/tab-cs4/index.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/tab/tab-cs4/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
          
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/tab/tab-cs4" %}

> In the above sample code, `#element` is the `id` of the HTML element in a page to which the Tab is initialized.

## Initialize the Tab using HTML elements

The Tab component can be rendered based on the given HTML element using `id` as `target`.

Header section must be enclosed with in a wrapper element using `e-tab-header` class and corresponding content must be mapped with `e-content` class.

You need to follow the below structure of HTML elements to render the Tab,

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}

  <div id='tab_html_markup'>   --> Root Tab element
    <div class="e-tab-header">      --> Tab header
       <div>   --> Header Item
       </div>
    </div>
    <div class="e-content">      --> Tab content
       <div>   --> Content Item
       </div>
    </div>
  </div>

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

* Add the HTML template data with its id attribute and add it in your `index.html` file to initialize the Tab.

`[src/index.html]`

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
